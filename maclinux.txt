# -*- mode: shell-script -*-
# Script to make the Mac more Linux-like
# Version 1.51 (c) Silas S. Brown 2012-2021.

# Tested in zsh on macOS 11.4
# and in bash on Mac OS X 10.7 through 10.14.

# This script can go in your ~/.zshrc (10.15+)
# or ~/.bashrc and/or ~/.bash_profile (older Macs)
# for example:
# curl http://ssb22.user.srcf.net/setup/maclinux.txt >> ~/.bash_profile
# or if you prefer you can keep it in a separate file
# and source it from your startup files
# (put "source ~/.maclinux" into .zshrc or .bashrc)

# You might wish to also put it in BASH_ENV to ensure all
# commands are copied to subshells, although commands without
# hyphens and dots should be copied over anyway.

# Spaces are turned into hyphens, e.g. for google-chrome.

# TODO: if we must write to /tmp, can we keep it cached
# so that new tabs in the Terminal window don't need to do
# a disk write? (e.g. by putting whole script in an 'if'
# clause which also does echo commands to declare the
# functions, or cache the o/p of "declare" and somehow
# remove what we didn't add), but how to check the age of
# the cache?  -newer /Applications?  with timeout?
# just make an 'update-functions' cmd for use when wanted?
